Predict probability of employees separating 

## Problem

Replacing employees who have separated is expensive, with estimates ranging from 1x to 2x annual salary in replacement costs (search, contract labor, lost productivity, hiring costs). Some voluntary separations are avoidable through interventions. Interventions can be expensive, and applying them broadly with targeting can be counter-productive.
